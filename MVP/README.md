# Vehicle Loan Default Prediction

In our project, some insightful information extracted to better understand the data.

First, our data shows a multivariate relationship between disbursed amount and current balance of loanee along with other variables. Heatmap constructed to show different relationships between variables.

Using Tableau tool, we further explored this relationship. Plotting both variables as measures summed; on the x-axis is disbursed amount, and on the y-axis is current balance. Figure shown below:

Last, we extended our exploration between our reponses and target variable by creating a baseline models (Logistics Regression and KNN) depicted in a confusion matrix.
